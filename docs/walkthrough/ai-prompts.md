# AI Prompts

On the right you’ll see a list of prompts. You can click any of these to have the AI write text for you. Let's try it now. Type the beginning of a story in the editor ("Once upon a time" will do). Click "Expand".

You'll see a spinner at the left of the prompt heading while Chisel gets data from the AI. Soon a suggestion will get added to the suggestions column. Click on the suggestion to add it to your text in the editor.

It's as easy as that! There are other prompts too that you can try. Try clicking "Rewrite" now. After a few seconds, you should get another suggestion.

Right now you are getting back one suggestion at a time. If you’d like, you can ask for more than one suggestion in response. Let’s see how to do that next in the settings panel.
