# The UI

 Let's walk through the user interface. The first thing we need to do is show all of it. You can do this by pressing escape twice. The first time you press escape, it will hide all the panels. The second time, it will show them all.

 The UI should look something like this:

 On the left, you'll find all your books and chapters. That's your map, so you don't have to worry about getting lost in your own writing jungle. 



The main attraction is in the middle – the editor. This is where the real writing magic happens. So, go ahead, and type away. 

Above the editor, You will see some icons, including a green checkmark:

If you see a green checkmark, it means all your edits have been automatically saved. But, if it changes to a dash, it's like a warning sign that your changes are not yet saved. Chisel saves your work every five seconds. If you can't wait that long, just hit command + S to save it yourself. 

Last but not least, you have two more columns on the right – prompts and suggestions. These will help you get out of a writer's block. Let’s talk about these next.
