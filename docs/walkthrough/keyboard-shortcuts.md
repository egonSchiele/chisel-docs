# Keyboard Shortcuts

- `command+shift+p`: invoke launcher
- `command+shift+d`: diff with block below
- `command+alt+down`: with selected text, extract text to new block. At the end of a block, create new empty block below current block.
- `command+alt+up`: at the start of a block, create new empty block below current block.
- `esc`: toggle UI


# Other useful shortcuts

- Clicking on an item in history will restore that editor state, wiping your current editor state. But if you command+click on it, it will restore that state into the current block only. So your current block will be cleared but everything else will be left untouched.
