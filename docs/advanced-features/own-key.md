:::danger Note
Giving your key to another person is a huge security risk. If you use this feature, you are taking on that risk.
:::

We don't store the key, but ultimately, your key is your responsibility. Make sure you have a usage limit set. This way, if your key falls into the wrong hands, you won't spend more than a certain amount each month.

**We are not liable for any issues/costs related to your key.**
