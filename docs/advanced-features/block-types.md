# Block types

 By default, blocks are in markdown mode. But you can also create plain text blocks or code blocks. To change a block, from the launcher choose "Convert to plain" or "Convert to code". You can also choose a language for syntax highlighting. Try choosing "change language to JavaScript". Syntax highlighting will show up in read mode.
