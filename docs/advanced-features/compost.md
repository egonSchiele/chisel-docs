# Compost Heap

Neil Gaiman says:

> I think itâ€™s really important for a writer to have a compost heap. Everything you read, things that you write, things that you listen to, people you encounter, they can all go on the compost heap. And they will rot down. And out of them grow beautiful stories.

The compost heap is a place for your unorganized notes. An interesting encounter, a funny story, a weird sign -- write about it here. Then, when you're stuck for ideas, your compost heap will be there, full of interesting things to spark your imagination.

To quickly add a note to your compost heap, press `cmd+shift+c`.
