# Reference Blocks

Sometimes there's a section of text that I know I need to refer to often. It may be a key moment in my book, description of a character, or some piece of tax I want to revisit and improve. I can put this text in a block, and mark it as a reference.

First, put the text in a block (read the section on blocks if you were not familiar with that concept). Invoke the launcher with `cmd+shift+p` and choose "Mark block as reference".

You will see a little are 'R' pop up next to it:

And the block will show up in your front matter:

Click on it and you will be taken directly to that block. This is a great way to gather text from across your book to look at later.
