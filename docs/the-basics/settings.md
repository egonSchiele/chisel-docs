# Settings panel

Click this icon to show the rightmost panel if you don't have it open:

![Icon to open sidebar (three dots all the way to the top right of the editor)](/img/ss/open-sidebar.png)

Then click the gear icon for settings:

Here, you can choose your AI preferences, including number of suggestions. Set it to 3 for more suggestions per response. Scroll to the bottom, hit Save, and voila! You'll get three responses now. 

The best part of the settings panel is the Prompt area. Here you can edit and add prompts.

Let's try adding a prompt. Click "New Prompt". In the two fields that show up, enter "Limerick" as the label. For the prompt, write:

```
Write a limerick based on this text: {{text}}
```

Hit save and try your new prompt! You'll get back a limerick. This is a powerful feature.

Let's explore the other icons. But before we do that, I want to show you something that'll help you work faster: the launcher.
