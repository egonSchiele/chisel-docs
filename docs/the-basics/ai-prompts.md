# AI Prompts

![screenshot of the green check mark](/img/ss/prompts.png)

On the right you’ll see a list of prompts. You can click any of these to have the AI write text for you. Let's try it now. Type the beginning of a story in the editor ("Once upon a time" will do). Click "Expand".

You'll see a spinner at the left of the prompt heading while Chisel gets data from the AI. Soon a suggestion will get added to the suggestions column. Click on the suggestion to add it to your text in the editor.

It's as easy as that! There are other prompts too that you can try. Try clicking "Rewrite" now. After a few seconds, you should get another suggestion.

## Versions

When you get a suggestion back, your current text will be replaced with a diff:

I chose to convert this text to present tense and you can see the results. My text is on the left, and what the AI returned is on the right. This way you can easily compare the changes. If you're happy with the change, click apply, otherwise click close. Either way both versions of the text are saved, and you can access them by clicking this icon:

You can read more about versions in the 'Versions' section.

Right now you are getting back one suggestion at a time. If you’d like, you can ask for more than one suggestion in response. Let’s see how to do that next in the settings panel.
