# The Launcher

![screenshot of the launcher](/img/ss/launcher.png)

One of my favorite features is the launcher - it's like the magic wand of Chisel. To find it, press command+shift+P. You'll see a drop-down of actions and a search bar. Use it to do everything you can do with a mouse, but faster. Want to make a new chapter? Search for "new chapter", use the arrow keys, hit enter, and tada - new chapter created! Need to hide the Settings panel? Search for "Close Settings", hit enter, and bam - it's closed. Use the launcher to navigate around your workspace and find anything you need. There are some things you can only do using the launcher, so be sure to check it out.

Now, let's check out the rest of those icons on the right.
